Capture procedure (from the paper):

bias frame (for the readout noise):
     - Set shutter time to highest value, take photo with lens cap on;

saturation frame:
     - Set shutter time to low value, take photo

flat field frames:
     - defocus lens
     - bring lens very close to monitor, that displays constant white.
     - set exposure such that pixel values are close to saturation.

flat field dark frames:
     - keep same exposure as the one used for the flat field, but put the lid on the lens
